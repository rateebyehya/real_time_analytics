# Real Time Analytics

Unleash the power of real-time marketing with our exciting project! Our team simulated an RTM app on SingleStore, providing in-depth analysis and creative data engineering solutions. 

## Project Statement 

Real-time marketing (RTM) is a new approach that companies are adopting today to interact with their customers in real-time, based on data about how they engage with the company's product or service through multiple channels. It contrasts with traditional marketing approaches that require planning out a marketing strategy for months before implementation. Companies engage customers with short, personalized messages about product information, customer benefits, promotion details, etc., on their mobile phones, at the right time and location. This methodology often involves a sense of urgency, as customers realize that the advertisements they receive are tailored to current events or trends, and hence the offerings provided could be the most helpful in the present moment. As a result, real-time marketing is often a creative approach to attract more customers and boost engagement, leading to increased conversion rates at each stage of the sales funnel. To conduct effective real-time marketing, it is essential to develop a holistic and well-organized system of collection and processing of customer behavior data across multiple channels and try to respond to them over the channel they prefer.

In this project, we used the SingleStore platform to simulate an RTM application and conduct data analytics based on the real-time data we collect from the business process. For the business process, advertisements from multiple businesses (or vendors) are sent to customers via notifications on their cell phone, based on information about their behaviors and real-time locations. When more than one company's offers match a specific customer, there is a bidding process to decide on which company's offer to send as the final offer.
